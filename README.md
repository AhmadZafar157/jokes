Project Report: Jokes API Backend

Introduction:
The Jokes API Backend project is designed to serve jokes to users through a RESTful API. The project follows a well-structured architecture based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach, offering clear organization and separation of concerns. The primary goal is to provide jokes to users, while considering user types, quantity, and billing. The backend is built using Node.js and MongoDB, and it includes authentication, role-based access control, and a mock billing module.

Architecture:
The project is structured around the RESTful architecture, utilizing the MVC pattern. The backend logic is separated into distinct modules, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability. Here is a breakdown of the main components:

1. Models:
   - `User`: Represents user data, including email, password, role, account number, and billing details.
   - `Joke`: Represents joke data, including text, category reference, submission information, and approval status.
   - `Category`: Represents joke categories, holding category name data.

2. Controllers:
   - `JokeController`: Handles endpoints related to jokes, including fetching random jokes, searching by keywords, retrieving jokes by category, and submitting new jokes (with approval).
   - `CategoryController`: Manages endpoints related to joke categories, offering functionality to retrieve all categories.

3. Middleware:
   - `Authentication`: A middleware responsible for authenticating users and attaching user role and ID to the request for role-based authorization.
   - `Authorization`: An authorization middleware could have been added for better security. It would prevent unauthorized requests from reaching endpoints, enhancing overall security.

4. Routes:
   - Route handlers in separate files within the `routes` folder ensure clear separation of route definitions and logic.

5. Config:
   - The configuration file handles the connection to the MongoDB database.

6. Billing Module:
   - A mock billing module is placed in the root directory, providing a foundation for future integration with billing services. This demonstrates potential scalability.

7. Entry Point:
   - The `index.js` file serves as the entry point, initializing the server, establishing database connections, and configuring routes.

Authentication and Authorization:
The project includes an authentication middleware that authenticates user requests. It attaches the user's role and ID to the request object, which is then used by controllers to implement role-based authorization. An authorization middleware could further enhance security by ensuring that unauthorized requests are intercepted before reaching endpoints.

Billing and User Types:
The project takes into consideration user types and the quantity of jokes requested. Billing is managed through the mock billing module, providing the foundation for future integration with real billing services. Different user types are handled through their assigned roles, allowing premium users to access additional features and billed requests.

Conclusion:
The Jokes API Backend project demonstrates a well-structured architecture based on the RESTful MVC pattern. Each joke is associated with a specific category, enhancing joke organization and retrieval. Additionally, billing details are stored as part of the user, though a separate billing module would have been a more scalable solution. Despite this, the project successfully implements authentication, role-based authorization, and a mock billing module to manage user accounts.

Furthermore, while the project successfully handles fetching random jokes, an ideal approach for searching jokes based on specific keywords would involve creating an endpoint for searching jokes using random words. Due to scope and time constraints, this feature wasn't implemented. In an expanded version, this could be achieved by using a search engine technology like Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient and accurate keyword-based joke retrieval.

In summary, the project showcases a clear approach to serving jokes through a user-friendly API, incorporating user roles, billing, and category associations. While certain aspects could be refined for scalability and additional features could be added, the project stands as a testament to the principles of RESTful design, MVC architecture, and role-based access control. Adding an authorization middleware would further enhance security by preventing unauthorized access at the middleware level.
